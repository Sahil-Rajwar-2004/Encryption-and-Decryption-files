Try this on your own operating system!

vecna.py will encrypt all the files where the vecna.py file is present except the thekey.key and eleven.py

Things to take care of:
1. Don't change the filename of vecna.py, thekey.key and eleven.py
2. Don't run the vecna.py file more than 1 times!
3. thekey.key and eleven.py are the most important files that can decrypt your all files

If you messed up! then I am not responsible for this
